## enharmonic equivalents

we know that c is a semitone above b, so b# is the same ptich as C

We call these enharmonic equivalents. They are different ways of 'spelling' the same pitch. 

We can think of enharmonic equivalents as notes which would be played by the same key on the piano. 


### aside on enharm equivalents

It is important to not confuse the two. When we talk about scales, intervals, etc, B# and c are different notes. 

We must remember the correct procedure for identifying intervals. 
if you see a-b# and you think, b# same as c so that's a minor third, thats completely wrong. We need to start by working out the number (2nd) and then the qulity (augmented). now, an augm 2nd is enharmonically equivalent to a minor third but they are not the same interval.
