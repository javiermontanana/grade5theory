### the meaning of chromatic 

maybe omit this? 


## chromatics scales

Chromatic scales aren't scales in the sense of major or minor scales, where each next note has to go up one letter. 

A chromatic scale is just a sequence of pitches rising by a semitone each. If you remember from enharmonic equivalents, there are many ways to spell a certain pitch. 

so this: a a# b

could also be written like this: a Bb B

or like this Bbb Bb Cb

or manay other ways. They are all enharmonically equivalent and as far as writing a chromatic scale goes, they are all equally correct. 

### aside

In reality, some of these make sense in the context of certain keys, and some of them in ohters. 


### chromatic scale question in the exam 

In the exam, you will be shown an attempt at a chromatic scale, and you need to say whether it's correct or not.
