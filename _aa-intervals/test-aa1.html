# Intervals 


## Interval numbers

An interval is a measure of the distance between two pitches, of how much higher one is than another. 

we are going to learn a certain framework for describing this distance. 


Firstly we are going to give the interval a number, which is simply the number of steps on the stave between the notes. 

So A - B is a second, 
A - C is a third, 
C - E is a third, 
A -E is a fourth. 
A - ,C is a sixth, 

As you can see, when we count the steps, we count both the bottom and the top note. So the smallest interval is a first (there is no zeroth). But we don't call it a first, we call it a prime. 

For the interval of an 8th, we use the workd octave. 

--------------------------

### Aside on interval numbers:

It's useful to remember that two notes both on lines, or two notes both on spaces will form odd-number intervals. 

eg  
whereas even-numbered intervals will always contain one note on a line and one on a space. 

----------------------------

### another aside 

it wont matter whether the bottom note comes first or second, or whether they happen at the same time. 

so this, this and this are all the same interval.
