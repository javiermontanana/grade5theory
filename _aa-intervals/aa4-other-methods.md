## other methods 

There are other methods for identifying intervals that don't always involve boiling them down to the notes of the C major scale. 

What all these methods have in common is that when we see an interval with too many sharps or flats for us to identify it as is, we will get rid of some to simplify it into an interval we can work out and then we will add the sharps and flats and calculate whether they make the interval bigger or smaller. 

Two of these methods are: 

- Using the major scale of the bottom note
- using a different major scale
