## other methods 

We have now learnt to identify any interval up to an octave. 
We have done this by using the C major scale as a reference. 
If we find an interval with sharps or flats, we simplify it down to one with notes from the C major scale, and then we add the sharps or flats. 

In the following sections, you will learn a couple other methods. 
This will help to deepen your understanding of intervals, and it will also give you several ways of finding the correct answer to a question, which is a very useful way of double-checking your answers in an exam. 

The other methods we will learn are:  

- Using the major scale of the bottom note
- Interval inversion
