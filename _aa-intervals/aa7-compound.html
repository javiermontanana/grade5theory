title: aa7 Compound intervals 
abc: true
---

<p>
    So far, we have only seen intervals up to an octave. In this section we will learn how to identify any interval bigger than an octave. Intervals bigger than an octave are called compound intervals. Intervals up to an octave are called simple intervals. 
</p>

<h2>
    number
</h2>

<p>
    The interval number works as you might expect. We still just count the number of stave positions. 
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="comp/de.svg" alt=""></td>
        <td><img src="comp/df.svg" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>This is a <strong>9th</strong></td>
        <td>This is a <strong>10th</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    But there is another way to describe the number of these intervals. 
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="comp/de.svg" alt=""></td>
        <td><img src="comp/df.svg" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>This is a <strong>compound 2nd</strong></td>
        <td>This is a <strong>compound 3rd</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    With use the word to mean "plus an octave." 
</p>

<p>
    Be careful not to get confused by the numbers. A second plus an octave is a ninth, even though 2+8=10. You can't just add the numbers together or you'll be over by one! Instead, count the steps. 
</p>

<h3>
    quality
</h3>

<p>
    The interval quality of a compound interval is the same as that of it's corresponding simple interval. This means that we can just shrink the interval by a (perfect) octave and find the quality of that interval. 
</p>

<p>
    Let's do an example:
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="comp/dhigis.svg" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>We want to identify this interval. We can count the number of steps and find that it is an 11th.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Let's shrink it by an octave. I will do this by lowering the top note, but you could also do it by raising the bottom note. 
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <td width="40%"><img src="comp/dgis.svg" alt=""></td>
        <td><img src="comp/dhigis.svg" alt=""></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>This is an <strong>augmented 4th</strong></td>
        <td>The original interval is therefore a <strong>compound augmented 4th</strong> or <strong>augmented 11th.</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>
