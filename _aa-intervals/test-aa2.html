<h1>
    Interval quality
</h1>


<p>

    As you might have noticed, not all thirds are the same size, not all seconds are the same size etc. 

    Obviously A - C# is bigger than A - C 
    
    B - C is smaller than C -D 
    
    So to fully describe an interval, we will need to be more precise. 
    
    We use the words Major, minor, perfect, augmented and diminished to fully describe the intervals. 
    
    We will start by looking at intervals only between natural notes, so the ones in the C mjaor scale. 
    
    Here's a reminder for a C major scale. all the steps are tones exceot BC EF which are semitones. 
    
</p>

<h3>
    Seconds
</h3>

<p>
    As we know, the seconds E-F and B-C are a semitone, whereas all the others are tones. 
    EF and BC are minor seconds, all the others are major.
    
</p>

<h3>
    Thirds
</h3>

<p>
    We can also see that some thirds are smaller than others. Some contain a tone and a semitone, whereas others contain two tones. Again here the smaller kinds of third are minor and the bigger ones are major. 

    If we highlight the semitones in the scale, we can quickly see that if the semitone is contained within the third, it is minor, otherwise it is major. 
</p>

<h3>
    Sixths and sevenths
</h3>

<p>
    With sixths and sevenths, something similar happens. 
    We see that some contain only one semitone and some contain two. 
    The ones that contain two are smaller so they are the minor ones. The ones that only contain one are major.

<h3>
    fourths and fifths
</h3>


<p>
    Fourths and fifths are a little different. Thay are not major or minor. 

    Most fourths contain two tones and a semitone. These we call perfect. The only exception is F-B, which doesn't contain a semitone (it contains 3 tones) we will call this one Augmented. 
    
    With fifths something similar happens. They all contain one semitone, except for B - F. we will call this one diminished and the others perfect. 
    
</p>

<h3>
    Octaves and primes
</h3>

<p>
    With octaves and primes, we only find one kind. All the primes have 0 tones and semitones and all the ocaves have the same number of tones and semitones. These we will also call perfect.
