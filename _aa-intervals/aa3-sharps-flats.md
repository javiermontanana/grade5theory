### what if there are sharps and flats?


If we have an interval with sharps or flats, we can first simplify it to an interval without and work it out. Then remember the chart on the page for interval quality and add the sharps and flats one by one to work out what they do to the interval. 

Example: C# - Eb
C-E is a major third
C# - E is a minor third
C# - Eb is dim third. 

note that it wouldnt matter if we add the flat first. try this 



### aside NB 

Remember that whether the first note is higher or lower doesnt matter. 

but make sure you dont get confused by sharps flat and whether they make the interval bigger or smaller. Raising the top note will make and interval bigger, but raising the bottom note will make it smaller.  


Other examples.

### aside on enharmonic euqivalents (delete this)

It is important not to be confused by enharmonic euqivalencies 

As far as intervals are concerned, there is no equivalence.
