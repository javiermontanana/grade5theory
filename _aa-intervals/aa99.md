    aside - useful to remember - put this later
</h3>
<p>
    It is useful to remember that of all the intervals we have seen in this page, the only augmented or diminished ones are F-B and B-F. Knowing this, we immediately know that all of the other 4ths and 5ths are perfect. We also know that no other interval that doesn't contain sharps and flat can be augmented or diminished,
