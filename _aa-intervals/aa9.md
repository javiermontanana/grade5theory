title: Building your musical intuition and understanding intervals 
abc: true
---


What you've learned in this chapter is more than enough to be able to identify any interval, and to answer any question on intervals in the Grade 5 Theory exam. But as you become more and more familiar with more music, you should develop this skill to the point where you can identify any interval within a couple of seconds. Recognising intervals quickly wihtout having to calculate is a bit like recognising words when you read them without having to look at each letter. It's part of what it means to become fluent reading music. 


There are probably some intervals that you could identify immediately very early on. I you know your tones and semitones it is immediately obvious that C-D is a major second and B-C is a minor second. As you become more experienced, there will be many more intervals that are just obvious like that. 


## strategies for string players

If you play a string instrument, you can think about the placment of notes on the fingerboard and use this to work out intervals. For instance, think about how you put the fingers to play a tone vs. a semitone, or a minor 3rd vs a major 3rd. This can really help you develop an intuition for intervals. If your instrument is tuned in perfect 5ths, you can use this as well: a perfect 5th is the same position on the fingerboard one stirng across. A major 6th is up one string an up a tone. A minor 6th is up a string plus up a semitone, and so on.... you can work out all the intervals in terms of positions on the fingerboard. (If your instrument is tuned some other way you should work these out for your instrument.)


## listening, singing and audiating

Even more important to your musical development than learning to identify written intervals is the ability to identify intervals in melodies that your hear. This is part of many aural tests and is a fundamental musical skill. You should train this ability by using your instrument or a piano to play different intervals. But the best way is to train yourself to be able to sing them reliably in tune. 

Audiation is the ability to hear a note in your mind. It's a bit like if I told you to imagine the colour red, you can probably mentally visualise the colour and have an image of the colour in your  mind. Well like that but with notes. This is a more advanced skill, but if you're able to recognise and sing intervals you should try to practise audiating them as well.
