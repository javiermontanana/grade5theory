<h1>
    learning to identify intervals in the C major scale 
</h1>

<p>
   In this section we will learn to fully identify all the intervals between any two notes from the C major scale. 
   By the end of this section you will be able to identify any interval between any notes, as long as they don't have any sharps or flats.  
</p>
<p>
   Below are 2 octaves of the C major scale. 
   The semitones (E-F and B-C) are highlighted. All the other steps are tones. 
   A step of a tone is bigger than a step of a semitone. Everything in this section will be based around this, so it's important that you are familiar with it. 
</p>

Let's go through all the intervals. 


<h3>Seconds</h3>

<p>
    We can see that all the seconds are tones, except for E-F and B-C which are semitones. 
    As  we know from the previous section, seconds can be major or minor. 
    So the tones are major, and the semitones are minor. 
</p>

<p>
    The animation below shows for all the seconds, whther they are major or minor. 
    As we move our two selected notes, we see that if the semitone falls inside the interval, it is minor. Otherwise it is major.

</div>



<h3>Thirds</h3>

<p>
    We can see that some thirds are made up of two tones, and others are made up of a tone and a semitone. 
    The ones with the semitone are smaller so they are minor. 
</p>

<p>
    In the animation below, you can see that if the semitone falls between the two notes, then it is a minor third.

</div>


<h3>Fourths</h3> 

<p>
    Remember that fourths can't be major or minor. Instead, they are perfect.
</p>
<p>
    Most fourths contain two tones and a semitone. Those are perfect. 
    The only exception is F-B, which doesn't contain a semitone (it contains 3 tones) so it's augmented. 
</p>

    <img src="qual/slides/4be.svg" alt="">
    <img src="qual/slides/4hicf.svg" alt="">
</div>


<h3>Fifths</h3>

<p>
    Like fourths, fifths are also perfect rather than major or minor. 
    Most fifths contain one semitone. The only exception is B-F, which contains two. 
    Because it contains an extra semitone, it is smaller than the perfect ones, so it is diminished. 
    This might seem confusing, but remember that when we say it contains an extra semitone, we don't mean that the interval is a semitone bigger. 
    We mean that one of the steps is a semitone <em>rather than a tone</em>, so the interval is actually a semitone <em>smaller.</em>

    <img src="qual/slides/5hicg.svg" alt="">
</div>


<h3>Sixths</h3>

<p>
    All the sixths contain at least one semitone, but some contain two. 
    The ones that contain two are smaller, so they are minor. 
    The ones that only contain one are major. 
</p>

    <img src="qual/slides/6hica.svg" alt="">
</div>

<h3>Sevenths</h3>

<p>
    Similar to sixths, sevenths are major if they contain one semitone, minor if they contain two. 
</p>

    <img src="qual/slides/7ba.svg" alt="">
    <img src="qual/slides/7hicb.svg" alt="">
</div>


<h3>Unisons and Octaves</h3>

<p>
    All the unisons and all the octaves are the same size. 
    All the unisons are between two of the same note, and all the octaves contain two semitones. 
    They are all perfect (remember: never major or minor).
</p>

<h2>
    Summary
</h2>

<p>
    Congratulations! You are now able to identify any interval between natural notes. 
    This is a very important step, so make sure you understand everything and you give yourself enough practice before tackling intervals with sharps and flats. 
</p>

<p>
    By the end of the next section, you will be able to identify <em>any interval</em> by using what you've learned in this section and in the previous one.
