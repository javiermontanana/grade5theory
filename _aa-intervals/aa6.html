title: aa6 interval inversion
abc: true

<p>
    To invert something means to turn it upside down. 
    In the case of intervals, it means that if we have an interval with, say, A above D, we will flip those around so that we have D above A. 
</p>

</div>

<p>
    We can do this by moving the bottom note up an octave, or by moving the top note down an octave.

    Try playing around with this. Write down a few intervals, identify them, invert them, then identify the inversion. You'll find that they always follow certain rules: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>the number of an interval and its inversion will always add up to 9. So a second inverts to a seventh, a third to a sixth and a fourth to a fifth. 
    </li>
    <li>
        A major interval inverts to a minor one, a perfect to a perfect, an augmented to a diminished and vice versa. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Interval inversion is very useful for identifying larger intervals, like 6ths and 7ths. Most people find those harder than 2nds and 3rd, but by inverting them, we can turn them into 2nds or 3rds. Then we can identify the inverted interval, and by following the rules above we then know what the original interval was.

<p>
    Instead of working out this interval, we can invert it. I will do this by lowering the top note by an octave, but one could also do it by raising the bottom note. 
</p>

<p>
    We can quickly see that this is a semitone, therefore a minor second, therefore the original interval was a major seventh.     
</p>

<p>
    Let's look at a more difficult example:
</p>


<img src="aa6/aesgis.svg" alt="">

Let's invert this and we have:

<img src="aa6/gisaes.svg" alt="">

<p>
    This is a little easier to identify:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>G-A is a major second</li>
    <li>G&sharp;-A is a minor 2nd</li>
    <li>G&sharp;-A&flat; is a diminished 2nd</li>
</ul>

<p>
    If the inverted interval is a diminished 2nd, then the original interval is an augmented 7th. 
</p>

<p>
    Now that we know about interval inversion, let's think back to something we learned in section 3. When we looked at all the intervals in the C major scale, we found that all the 2nds, 3rds, 6ths and 7ths were major or minor, and all the 4ths and 5ths were perfect apart from B-F and F-B. 
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><img src="aa6/fb.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="aa6/bf.svg" alt=""></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>F-B is an augmented 4th</td>
        <td>B-F is a diminished 5th</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    F-B and B-F are the inversion of one another! They are an augmented 4th and the diminished 5th! All the other intervals are major, minor or perfect. If we invert them we have another major, minor or perfect interval. But these to are the only exceptions, which invert onto each other. 
</p>


<p>
    In an exam, I would encourage you to invert every sixth and seventh, use this as a second method of identifying the interval, and as a way to double check you answers.
