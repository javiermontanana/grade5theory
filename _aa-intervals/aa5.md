Let's look at the C major scale again. 
This time, we're going to identify the intervals from note 1 of the scale (C) up to each of the other notes.

We can see that all the intervals are either perfect or major. 
If you are unsure about this go back to the section where we identified all intervals in the C major scale and review that. 


What's useful about this is that this is not only true of C major, it is true of any major scale. 
The interval between the first note and any of the notes above is always major or perfect. 

Here are those intervals in E major, for exmaple.

Let's use this method to identify the interval D - B flat





Let's try a harder one. 

D# - C 

We could, in theory, use the D# major scale to identify this interval. 
But actually we can just use D major! 
D# major is probably a scale you've never seen before, so  it will be much easier this way. 
This will allow us to identify the interval starting form D, then we will just add the sharp to the D. 


D major has a C#, (2 sharps in the key signature)
so D-C# is a major 7th
so D-C is a minor 7th, 
so D# - C is a diminished 7th.
