title: aa5 identifying intervals using the major scale of the bottom note
abc: true
---




This method is based on the fact that the interval from the tonic (first note) of a major scale up to any note in the scale is either major or perfect.

Let's look at C major first to see this: 

But this is of course true in any major scale so for example in E major: 

We can use this fact to identify any interval.

example: 

D - Bb


G# - E 
We might not want to think in terms of the G# major scale, so we can work out G- E first.
E natural is in the G major scale, so G-E is a major 6th.
Therefore G#-E is a minor 6th.
