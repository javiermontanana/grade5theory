<h2 id="interval-quality">interval quality</h2>

<p>
    As you may have already noticed, the interval number doesn't give us all the information about an interval. 
</p>

<p>
    For example:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        A-B is a second. B-C is also a second, but B-C is a semitone, whereas A-B is a tone. The interval A-B is therefore bigger than B-C.
    </li>
    <li>
        The note C&sharp; is higher than the note C, so the interval A-C&sharp; is bigger than A-C, but both are thirds. (Remember that to find the interval number we only looked at the number of stave positions.) 
    </li>
    <li>
        C-E and D-F are both thirds, but C-E is made up of two tones, whereas D-F is made up of a tone and a semitone. 
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    In addition to the interval number, to fully describe an interval, we will need something else called interval quality.  
</p>

<p>
    To describe the interval quality, we use the words <strong>major, minor, perfect, augmented</strong> and <strong>diminished</strong>. Once we have found the number and quality of an interval, we have identified the interval. 
</p>

<p>
    We will see that some intervals (namely 2nds, 3rds, 6ths and 7ths) can be major or minor. The major interval will be bigger than the minor interval by one semitone. If we made the major interval even bigger by one semitone, it would be augmented. If we made the minor interval even smaller by one semitone, it would be diminished. 
</p>

<p>
    Other intervals (unisons, 4ths, 5ths and octaves) can be perfect (these can't be major or minor). If we made a perfect interval one semitone bigger, it would be augmented. If we made a perfect interval one semitone smaller, it would be diminished. 
</p>

<p>
    We can now draw the following chart to summarise the meaning of these words. 
</p>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="4">2nds, 3rds, 6ths, 7ths</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

    Look at the examples below and check that they all follow these rules. We haven't yet learned how to identify intervals, but, you can check that the examples below follow the rules stated above.

    If this is new to you and seems very confusing, don't worry! You will soon become familiar with these terms and with practice, you will soon be able to identify any interval. 
    In the next page, we will go through all the intervals in the C major scale and identify them, and from there, you will soon be able to identify any interval.
