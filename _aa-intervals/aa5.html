title: Using the major scale of the bottom note

<p>
    Let's look at the C major scale again. 
    This time, we're going to identify the intervals from note 1 of the scale (C) up to each of the other notes. 
</p>


<div class="slideshow cmajintervalfromc">
    <img class="active" src="aa5/cmaj/1.svg" alt="">
    <img src="aa5/cmaj/2.svg" alt="">
    <img src="aa5/cmaj/3.svg" alt="">
    <img src="aa5/cmaj/4.svg" alt="">
    <img src="aa5/cmaj/5.svg" alt="">
    <img src="aa5/cmaj/6.svg" alt="">
    <img src="aa5/cmaj/7.svg" alt="">
    <img src="aa5/cmaj/8.svg" alt="">
</div>


<p>
    We can see that all the intervals are either perfect or major! 
    If you are unsure about this go back and review the section where we identified all intervals in the C major scale. 
</p>

<p>
    This is very useful, because it is not only true of C major; it is true of any major scale. 
    <strong>In any major scale, the interval from note 1 up to any of the other notes of the scale will always be perfect or major. </strong>
</p>

<p>
    As an example, let's think about some notes in the E major scale.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>E is note 1 of the scale.</li>
    <li>B is note 5, and E - B is a perfect fifth.</li>
    <li>C&sharp; is note 6, and E - C&sharp; is a major 6th.</li>
</ul>   

<p>
    If we know our major scales, this gives us a different method for identifying intervals. Let's use this to identify the interval G - E&flat;.
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><img src="aa5/ges.svg" alt=""></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>We wany to identify the interval G-E&flat;</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    The note E&flat; is not in the G major scale, but the note E is. It is the sixth note of the scale, so D - E is a major 6th, which means that G - E&flat; is a minor 6th. 
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><img src="aa5/ge.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="aa5/ges.svg" alt=""></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>G - E is a major 6th</td>
        <td>so G - E&flat; is a minor 6th</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Let's try a harder one. 
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><img src="aa5/disc.svg" alt=""></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>let's try to identify the interval D&sharp;-C</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    We could, in theory, use the D&sharp; major scale to identify this interval, but that would get very complicated. 
    D&sharp; major is a scale you've probably never seen before. 
    But we can instead use D major, which is a scale we are all more familiar with.  
</p>

<img src="aa5/dmajb.svg" alt="">

<p>
    D major has 2 sharps in the key signature, so it has a C&sharp; as the 7th note. 
    So we know that D-C&sharp; is a major 7th. 
    We will work from that starting point and then add a natural to the C and a sharp to the D to get to the interval we wanted to identify. 
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
            <th><img src="aa5/dcis.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="aa5/dc.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="aa5/disc.svg" alt=""></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>D-C&sharp; is a <strong>major 7th</strong></td>
        <td>D-C&natural; is a <strong>minor 7th</strong></td>
        <td>D&sharp;-C&natur; is a <strong>diminished 7th</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>


<p>
    If you are not very confident with your major scales, make sure you get better at them and come back to this method later.
