title: aa7 interval inversion

Inverting an interval means turning it upside down. 
So for excample if we have the following interval:

D-A

and we invert it we will obtain an interval with a D above an A rather than below it. 

We can see that the way to obtain this is to move the bottom note up an octave, or to move the top note down an octave. 


If you play around and invert a few intervals, you will see that the inversions will always follow certain rules. 

- the number of an interval and its inversion will always add up to 9. So a sefcond inverts to a seventh, a third to a sixth and so on. 
- A major interval inverts to a minor one, a perfect to a perfect, an augmented to a diminished and vice versa. 
- If we invert an interval, and then invert the inverison we end up with the same interval we started with. 


Interval inversion is very useful. It's going to give us another method for identifying intervals that is particularly useful for larger intervals like 6ths and 7ths. 

Let's say we have this 7th. 

F - E 

Instead of working out this interval, we can invert it. 

E-F 

We can quickly see that this is a semitone, therefore a minor second. 

Therefore the original interval was a major seventh. 

Let's look at a more difficult example.

Ab - G# 

Let's invert this to

G#-Ab

G-A major 2
G#-A minor 2
G#-Ab dim 2

If this is a diminished second, that means that the original interval was an augmented 7th. 




### afterthought

now it should make sense that when we looked at all the intervals in the C major scale, B-F and F-B were the only augmented and diminished ones. the dim 5th and aug 4th are the onversion of each other. Every other interval is major minor or perfect and so will also inver to a major minor or perfect.
