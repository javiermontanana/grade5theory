<h3>what we've learnt so far</h3>


<p>
    In the last section we learnt to identify all the intervals between notes in the C major scale. 
    In the section before that, we learnt about the words major, minor, perfect, augmented and diminished. 
    Here is the chart again showing what they mean. 
</p>

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="4">2nds, 3rds, 6ths, 7ths</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>diminished</td>
                <td>minor</td>
                <td>major</td>
                <td>augmented</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td colspan="4">unisons, 4ths, 5ths, 8ves</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>diminished</td>
                <td colspan="2">perfect</td>
                <td>augmented</td>
            </tr>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td colspan="4">
                &larr; smaller  ------  bigger &rarr;
            </td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

<p>
    Now we can put together everything we've learnt and this will allow us to identify any interval. 
</p>

<p>
    If we have an interval with some sharps or flats, we will ignore the sharps and flats to begin with and pretend that both notes are natural. Then we will identify <em>that</em> interval. 
    Once we've done that we can add the sharps and flats one by one. 
    As we add each accidental, we will identify the interval, using the chart above, and taking into account whether the accidental makes the interval bigger or smaller.  
</p>

<p>
    Remember that any sharps and flats only affect the interval quality, never the number. 
    The number depends only on the stave positions or letter names of the notes. 
</p>

<p>Let's look at a simple exmaple.</p>
   
<table>
    <tr>
        <th><img src="qual/acis.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="qual/ac.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="qual/acis.svg" alt=""></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="30%">A-C&sharp; is a <strong>third</strong></td>
        <td width="30%">A-C is a <strong>minor 3rd</strong></td>
        <td>A-C&sharp; is one semitone bigger, so it is a <strong>major 3rd</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>Here's another example</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th><img src="qual/cises.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="qual/ce.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="qual/cise.svg" alt=""></th>
        <th><img src="qual/cises.svg" alt=""></th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td width="25%">C&sharp;-E&flat; is a <strong>third</strong></td>
        <td width="25%">C-E is a <strong>major 3rd</strong></td>
        <td>C&sharp;-E is one semitone smaller, so it is a <strong>minor 3rd</strong></td>
        <td>C&sharp;-E&flat; is one semitone smaller, so  it is a <strong>diminished 3rd</strong></td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Remember that a sharp raises a pitch by a semitone, so if it's on the higher note it will make the interval bigger, but if it's on the lower note it will  make it smaller. 
</p>

<p>
    Notice that it wouldn't matter if we added the flat first and then the sharp. 
    That would give us: 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>C-E is a major third.</li>
    <li>C-E&flat; is a minor 3rd.</li>
    <li>C&sharp;-E&flat; is a diminished 3rd.</li>
</ul>    

<p>
    If you identify the intervals correctly at every stage, you will get the same result.
</p>

<p>
    Congratulations! If you have understood everything up to this point, you can now identify any interval up to an octave!
    Make sure you get a lot of practice identifying intervals. 
    It will help you understand many other topics in music theory.
