NB - for now, we will only be dealing with intervals up to an octave until we get to the page on compound intervals. 

## interval quality 

As you might have noticed, not all thirds are the same size, not all seconds are the same size etc. 

C# is higher than C, so
A - C# is bigger than A - C,
and yet they are both 3rds. 

B - C is smaller than C -D 
Because b-c is a semitone and c-d is a tone, 
and yet they are both seconds. 


C-E is composed of two tones. 
D-F is a tone and a seitone,
so C-E is bigger, but they are both 3rds. 


We can see that the number does not fully describe an interval, and we will need someting else to be more precise. 


We will use the words Major, minor, perfect, augmented and diminished to  escribe the quality of intervals. If we can identify an interval by the number and quality, then we have fully identified it. 



## meaning of perfect major minor diminished and augmented

We will see that some intervals (namely 2nds, 3rds, 6ths and 7ths) can be Major or minor. The major interval will be bigger than the minor interval by one semitone. If we made it even bigger by one semitone, it would be augmented. If we made the minor interval even smaller by one semitone, it would be diminished. 


Other intervals (unisons, 4ths, 5ths and octaves) can be perfect (these can't be major or minor). If they are one semitone bigger, they would be augmented. If they are one semitone smaller they will be diminished. 


Look at the examples below and check that they all follow the rules in this section. 


We can now draw the following table to remind ourselves of the meaning of these new words. 


| 2nds 3rds 6th 7ths                               ||||
| Diminished            | Minor   | Major | Augmented |
| primes 4ths 5ths 8ves                            ||||
| Diminished            | Perfect        || Augmented |

smaller   ------------------------------  bigger 

If this is new to you and seems very confusing, don't worry! You will soon become familiar with these terms and with practice, you will soon be able to identify any interval. 

In the next page, we will go thorough all the intervals in the C major scale and identify them. Then we will see that from there, we will be able to identify any interval.

# learning to identify intervals in the C major scale 


We will start by looking at intervals only between natural notes, so the ones in the C mjaor scale. 

Here's a reminder of a C major scale. all the steps are tones exceot BC EF which are semitones. 

It's written in two octaves, in order to allow us to see the interval from any note up to any note. 


#### Seconds

As we know, the seconds E-F and B-C are a semitone, whereas all the others are tones. 
EF and BC are minor seconds, all the others are major.

#### Thirds 

We can also see that some thirds are smaller than others. Some contain a tone and a semitone, whereas others contain two tones. Again here the smaller kinds of third are minor and the bigger ones are major. 

If we highlight the semitones in the scale, we can quickly see that if the semitone is contained within the third, it is minor, otherwise it is major. 


#### Sixths

With sixths something similar happens. 
We see that some contain only one semitone and some contain two. 
The ones that contain two are smaller so they are the minor ones. The ones that only contain one are major. 

If this is confusing, think about it a little before going on: if 

#### Sevenths

Just like with 6ths, 7ths are major if they contain one semitone, minor if they contain 2. 

#### Fourths and fifths

Fourths and fifths can't be major or minor. Instead, they can be perfect. 

Most fourths contain two tones and one semitone. These are perfect. The only exception is F-B, which doesn't contain a semitone (it contains 3 tones) so it's augmented. 

With fifths something similar happens. They all contain one semitone, except for B - F which contains 2. B-F is diminished, the others are perfect. 


#### Octaves and Primes

With octaves and primes, we only find one kind. All the primes have 0 tones and semitones and all the ocaves have the same number of tones and semitones. These are all perfect. 


### recap

We have now successfully identified all the intervals that can be formed between any two natural notes (within the span of an octave). 

This is the most important step in identifying intervals so make sure you understand everything on this page before you go on further. 



### aside - useful to remember

It is useful to remember that of all the intervals we have seen in this page, the only augmented or diminished ones are F-B and B-F. 

Knowing this, we immediately know that all of the other 4ths and 5ths are perfect. We also know that no other interval that doesn't contain sharps and flat can be augmented or diminished,
