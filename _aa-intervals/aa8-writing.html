<p>
    As well as being able to identify intervals, we need to be able write intervals. This means that if we are given a certain note, and an interval, we need to be able to write another note above or below it that forms that given interval. To be able to do this, we don't need to learn any thing new, we just need to use what we've already learned to find such a note.

<p>write a note that is a major 7th above the given note</p>

<p>As usual, we start with the interval number. The given note is a G, so we need to write an F above it.</p>

    We now have a 7th of some sort, but if we identify this interval we will see that it's a minor 7th. We therefore need to raise the note to an F&sharp; to make it a major 7th.
