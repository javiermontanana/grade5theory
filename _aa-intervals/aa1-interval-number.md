# Intervals 


## Interval numbers

An interval is a measure of the distance between two pitches or notes, of how much higher one is than another. 

The first step in learning to identify intervals is to find the interval number. The interval number is the number of steps on the stave contained between the two notes. You can also think of this as the number of letter names between them. When we count these, we will always count both the bottom and the top notes, plus any in between. 

For example, the interval A-B would have interval number 2, and we call it a second. A-C would be a third, and so on...

Look at some examples below.

|:--:|
|*G - A is a second*|


|![](number/third.svg)|
|:--:|
|*G - B is a third*|

The smallest interval number there can be is 1 (that's when we have the same note twice), but we don't call this interval a first; we call it a unison. Unison comes from latin, meaning one sound, as in, it's the same note! 

The interval with number 8 we also don't call an eighth; we call it an octave. The octave (and of course, the unison) is always between two notes which share the same letter name. For now, until we get to the section on compound intervals, we won't be dealing with any intervals bigger than an octave.

### Aside on interval numbers:(delete this?)

It's useful to remember that two notes both on lines, or two notes both on spaces will form odd-number intervals. 

eg  

whereas even-numbered intervals will always contain one note on a line and one on a space. 

----------------------------

### another aside 

As far as identifying the interval is concerned, it doesn't matter whether the lower or the higher comes first, or whether they happen at the same time.

Before you go on to learn about interval quality, make sure you have some practice at identifying interval numbers.
