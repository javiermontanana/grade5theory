# Intervals 


## Interval numbers

An interval is a measure of the distance between two pitches, of how much higher one is than another. 

we are going to learn a certain framework for describing this distance. 


First, we are going to give the interval a number, which is simply the number of steps on the stave between the notes. 

you can think of this as the number of letter names, or the number of steps in a scale. 

When we count, we will include both the bottom and the top notes. 

So A - B is a second, 
A - C is a third, 
C - E is a third, 
A -E is a fourth. 
A - ,C is a sixth, 

Because we count the both the bottom and top notes, there is no interval with the number 0. The smallest number is 1. 

This interval is not called a first, it is called a prime or unison. 

The interval with number 8 is not called and 8th, it's called an octave. 


--------------------------

### Aside on interval numbers:

It's useful to remember that two notes both on lines, or two notes both on spaces will form odd-number intervals. 

eg  

whereas even-numbered intervals will always contain one note on a line and one on a space. 

----------------------------

### another aside 

it doesn't matter whether the bottom note comes first or second, or whether they happen at the same time. 

so this, this and this are all the same interval.
